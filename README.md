 # IPL-Winning-Predictor

 ### Description:
 In this Project, the dataset that I have collected on matches and deliveries from Kaggle website from 2008 to 2019.
 The entire code I did on Jupyter notebook. The main aim of this project is to find the Probability 
 of win and loss of IPL matches. And the code is run on VS Code. And Probability of win and loss 
 also depends on the host city, crr and rrr in my Project. The whole project is developed using python code.
 ##
 ### Aims and Objectives: 
 The main aim of this project is to find the Probability of win and loss of IPL Matches. Also it used to predict the current run rate, and required run rate. 
 Both the Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest gives the most accuracy.  So we can choose anyone for creating a predicting model.
